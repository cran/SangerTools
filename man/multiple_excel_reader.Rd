\description{
This function reads multiple excel files into R after which all files are aggregated into  a single data frame.


There are assumptions about they underlying files:
\itemize{
  \item All files must have column names for each column (The function will fail without this; later versions will amend this)
  \item All files have the same number of columns
  \item All files have the same column names
  \item All files should have data starting from the same row number
  \item All relevant data is stored in the same sheet in each of the files
}
