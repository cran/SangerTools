\title{Read Multiple CSV files into R}
\usage{
multiple_csv_reader(file_path, sheet = 1, rows_to_skip = 0, col_names = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{The Directory in which the files are located}

\item{sheet}{Sheet to read. Either a string (the name of a sheet), or an integer (the position of the sheet). Defaults to the first sheet}

\item{rows_to_skip}{The number of rows from the top to be excluded}

\item{col_names}{If columns are named; defaults to TRUE}
}
\value{

\description{
This function reads multiple CSVs in a directory must be same structure.
This function reads multiple excel files into R after which all files are aggregated into  a single data frame.


There are assumptions about they underlying files:
\itemize{
  \item All files must have column names for each column (The function will fail without this; later versions will amend this)
  \item All files have the same number of columns
  \item All files have the same column names
  \item All files should have data starting from the same row number
  \item All relevant data is stored in the same sheet in each of the files
}
}
\examples{
library(SangerTools)
file_path <- "my_file_path_where_csvs_are_stored"
if (length(SangerTools::multiple_csv_reader(file_path)) == 0) {
  message("This won't work without changing the variable input to a local file path with CSVs in")
}
