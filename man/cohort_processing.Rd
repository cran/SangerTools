  df,
  Split_by,
  path,
  prefix = "DSCRO",
  com_code = "11M",
  date_format = "\%Y\%m\%d",

\arguments{
\item{df}{a tidy dataframe in standard Master Patient Index format ie SangerTools::PopHealthData.}

\item{Split_by}{A column within df that will be used to split the patients and will also appear in the file name. Ideally should be a health organisation code such as GP Practice Code or Hospital Trust Code. Should only have alpha-numeric values}

\item{path}{A file path to which the CSV files will be written}

\item{prefix}{File name prefix, default is "DSCRO" See more here: \href{ https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/keeping-patient-data-safe/gdpr/gdpr-register/data-services-for-commissioners-regional-offices-dscro-gdpr-information/data-services-for-commissioners-regional-offices-dscro-ambulance}{NHS DSCRO}}

\item{com_code}{Commissioner Code, default is "11M"; Gloucestershire.}

\item{date_format}{A date format passed internally to `format(Sys.Date())`; will form part of file name to denote date of generation. You can read more about date formatting in R \href{https://r-lang.com/r-date-format/}{from R lang}}

\item{suffix}{A file name suffix, default is "_REID_V01", To be left as blank use "", without spaces.}

n number of CSV files written to the location specified by path argument.

\description{
Population Health Management commonly leads practitioners to identify a cohort that will have an intervention applied.
As a rule of thumb most analysts will work with pseudonymised data sets. For targeted interventions patients require re-identification;
this process is generally carried out by a third party organisation. As third party organisations work with many health care providers they have a strict set of
requirements. This has been based around SW CSU's required formatting.
